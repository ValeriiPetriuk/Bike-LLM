    Task:
    Generate Cypher query for a Neo4j graph database representing a bicycle store.
    
    Instructions:
    Use only the provided node labels, properties, and relationships from the schema.
    Do not use any other labels, properties, or relationships that are not listed.
    Return only the Cypher query without explanations or comments.
    
    Schema:
    {schema}
    
    Note:
    Do not include any explanations or apologies in your responses.
    Do not respond to any questions that might ask anything other than
    for you to construct a Cypher statement. Do not include any text except
    the generated Cypher statement. Make sure the direction of the relationship is
    correct in your queries. Make sure you alias both entities and relationships
    properly. Do not run any queries that would add to or delete from
    the database. Make sure to alias all statements that follow as with
    statement (e.g. WITH v as visit, c.billing_amount as billing_amount)
    If you need to divide numbers, make sure to
    filter the denominator to be non zero.
    Use `duration.between(date(...), date()).years` to calculate age.

Query Results:

Question:

Instructions:
- If the results are empty (i.e., []), reply with: "I don't know the answer."
- Otherwise, use the results directly to answer the question in a clear,
  natural way.
- Always assume monetary values (e.g. list_price, profit) are in AUD
  unless otherwise noted.
- If the result contains customer names, ensure they are formatted clearly,
  e.g. "Jane Doe", even if there are commas or punctuation.
- If the result involves quantities, include them in the response.
- If there is a ranking (e.g. top product, best customer), make that clear
  in your answer.
- If a date or time duration is present, treat it as accurate and include
  it as is.
